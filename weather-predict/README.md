# WeatherApp
Created a Weather App using Boostrap and PHP. 
Gathering the information of the weather of the entered city and displaying it using the API from 'openweathermap.org'.
Shows the weather of any city you enter provided it is in the database of openweathermap.
Entering wrong city will ask you to enter a correct city name.

You will need to run this on a server because it is a php file.
